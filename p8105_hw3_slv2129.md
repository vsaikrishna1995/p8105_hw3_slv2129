Data description:

*How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?*

``` r
no_aisles = instacart %>% 
            distinct(aisle) %>% 
            count()

aisle_orders = instacart %>% 
               count(aisle) %>% 
               arrange(desc(n))

#The top five aisles that have the most items ordered from are as follows:#
aisle_orders %>% select(aisle) %>% head(5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 1
    ##   aisle                     
    ##   <chr>                     
    ## 1 fresh vegetables

    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits
    ## 4 yogurt                    
    ## 5 packaged cheese

There are 134 aisles in the instacart.

*Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.*

``` r
aisle_orders_10000 = aisle_orders %>% filter(n > 10000) #limiting the dataset to contain only aisles that have orders more than 10000 items#

ggplot(aisle_orders_10000, aes(x = reorder(aisle, desc(n)), y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

*Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.*

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients","dog food care","packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank < 4) %>%
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>%
  select(-rank) %>%
  kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n |

*Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).*

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour_of_day = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour_of_day
  ) %>%
  kable()
```

## Problem 2

*Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).*

``` r
accel = read.csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
        pivot_longer(activity.1:activity.1440, 
                     names_to = "min_of_day",
                     names_prefix = "activity.",
                     values_to = "activity_count") %>%
        mutate(day_class = ifelse(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", 
                       "weekend", "weekday"), min_of_day = as.numeric(min_of_day)) %>%
        clean_names() %>%
        select(week, day_id, day_class, day, min_of_day, activity_count)
```

Description of Accelerometer dataset:

This dataset consists of five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a
63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac
Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). The initial dataset has been transformed
from a wide format structure to a long format dataset. After performing
other manipulations and cleaning, a dataset with the following variables
has been created: week, day\_id, day\_class, day, min\_of\_day,
activity\_count. Currently, this dataset consists of 50400 observations.
The dimensions of the dataset are as follows: 50400, 6 (rows, columns).
The min\_of\_day variable records the minutes of the day and
activity\_count records the activity performed at that respective
minute.

*Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?*

``` r
accel %>% 
  mutate(day = factor(day, levels = c("Monday", 
         "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>%
  group_by(week, day_id,  day_class, day) %>%
  summarize(actvity_day_total = sum(activity_count)) %>%
  kable() 
```

It can be inferred from the table above that this individual didn’t
perform a lot of activity on the Saturdays of Week 4 and Week 5. The
individual also seems to have performed lower amount of activity on the
Monday of Week 1 (day 2), when compared to the activity of the other
days. Compared to all the weeks, it seems like Week 4 recorded the least
amount of activity.

*Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph*

``` r
accel %>% 
 ggplot(aes(x = min_of_day, y = activity_count)) +
       geom_smooth(aes(color = day)) +
       facet_wrap(~day_id)
```

From the above single-panel plot, we can deduce that the individual
usually performed high activity on Fridays, especially towards the end
of the day. However, day 22 seems to be an exception where there wasn’t
any high level of activity recorded towards the end of the day.
Saturdays seem to have high amounts of activity recorded during the
middle of the day, while the Sundays had steady level of activity. Day
16 recorded the highest amount of activity during the end of the day,
when compared to the activity performed on the other days. One can also
infer that there was more amount of activity registered during the
beginning weeks (week 1, week 2, week 3), when compared to the other
weeks.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
ny_noaa = ny_noaa
```

Description of the dataset:

This dataset consists of records related to all the New York state
weather stations from January 1, 1981 through December 31, 2010 and the
associated variables are as follows: id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax,
tmin. (2595176, 7) (rows, columns) is the dimension of the dataset and
there are 2595176 observations within this dataset. The tmax and tmin
variables store the numerical information of maximum and minimum
temperatures recorded over the years at every New York state weather
station. Similarly, prcp and snow store numerical information related to
rainfall and snowfall amount. This dataset has quite a bit of missing
data, which is 3387623 entries across all fields.

*Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?*

``` r
ny_noaa_tidy = ny_noaa %>%
               clean_names() %>%
               mutate(year = lubridate::year(date), 
                      month = lubridate::month(date), 
                      day = lubridate::day(date)) %>% #spliting the date into components#
               select(id, year, month, day, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin) %>% #rearranging#
               mutate(prcp = prcp/10,           #converting units to mm#
                      tmax = as.numeric(tmax),  #converting data type to numeric#
                      tmax = tmax/10,           #converting units to degrees C#
                      tmin = as.numeric(tmin),  
                      tmin = tmin/10)

ny_noaa_tidy %>% 
count(snow)  %>%
arrange(desc(n)) %>%
head(4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 2
    ##    snow       n
    ##   <int>   <int>
    ## 1     0 2008508
    ## 2    NA  381221
    ## 3    25   31022
    ## 4    13   23095

``` r
#From the table below, we can interpret that the most commonly observed values of snowfall are 0, 25 and 13 mm. These are considered to be the most commonly observed values because they appeared the most amount of the times during this observed timeline. However, the 2nd most commonly observed record wasn't mentioned above because it is a missing value.#
```

*Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers?*

``` r
avg_max_temp = ny_noaa_tidy %>%
               filter(month == 1 | month == 7) %>%
               group_by(id, year, month) %>%
               summarize(avg_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'id', 'year' (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
avg_max_temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_tmax)) +
      geom_line(aes(group = id)) +
      facet_grid(~month)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 5640 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

![](p8105_hw3_slv2129_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

From the graph above, we can deduce that the month of July had higher
average max temperature than January across the years. One can also
infer that the range of average max temperature has increased over the
years for January and this could probably be attributed to the effect of
global warming. Yes, there are a few outliers that can be observed in
both January and July months that indicate extreme average max
temperatures.

*Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.*

``` r
tmax_tmin = ny_noaa_tidy %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) +
                  geom_hex()

snow_dist = ny_noaa_tidy %>%
            filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100) %>%
            ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow)) +
                  geom_boxplot(aes(group = year))

tmax_tmin + snow_dist
```

    ## Warning: Removed 1136276 rows containing non-finite values (stat_binhex).
